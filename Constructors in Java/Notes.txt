Constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object

Agar tumne Constructor nahi banaya hai toh ye by default khud bana deta hai islea isko default Constructor bhi kehte hai

Constructors must have the same name as the class within which it is defined 

it is not necessary for the method in Java.

Constructors are called only once at the time of Object creation while method(s) can be called any number of times.

A constructor that has no parameters is known as default the constructor. A default constructor is invisible. And if we write a constructor with no arguments, the compiler does not create a default constructor. 

A constructor that has parameters is known as parameterized constructor. If we want to initialize fields of the class with our own values, then use a parameterized constructor.
